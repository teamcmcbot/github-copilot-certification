## ðŸŽ¯ Objective: Explain responsible usage of AI

### Key Learning Goals:

- **Describe the risks associated with using AI**  
- **Explain the limitations of using generative AI tools**  
  _(e.g. depth of the source data for the model, bias in the data, etc.)_  
- **Explain the need to validate the output of AI tools**  
- **Identify how to operate a responsible AI**  
- **Identify the potential harms of generative AI**  
  _(e.g. bias, insecure code, fairness, privacy, transparency)_  
- **Explain how to mitigate the occurrence of potential harms**  
- **Explain ethical AI**

> ðŸ“Œ These objectives build a foundational understanding of how to use GitHub Copilot in a secure, ethical, and socially responsible manner.
